DS8002 - Machine Learning

This are all the project assignments for course DS8002 - Machine Learning at Ryerson's University Masters in Data Science and Analytics.

I have taken this course during fall 2016 with Dr. Ayse Bener at Ryerson University in Toronto, ON. 

The course is an overview of basic machine learning methods, based on Alpaydin, E., Introduction to Machine Learning, 3e, MIT Press, 2014. and it covers the following content

1.	Week 1: Introduction and review of basic statistics
2.	Week 2: Supervised Learning
3.	Week 3: Bayesian Decision Theory and non-parametric methods
4.	Week 4: Decision Trees and ML Experiments
5.	Week 5: Mid term exam
6.	Week 6: Fall Break
7.	Week 7: Linear Discrimination and Multi Layer Perceptron
8.	Week 8: Parametric and Multivariate
9.	Week 9: Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering
10.	Week 10: Kernel Machines
11.	Week 11: Combining Learners
12.	Week 12: Reinforcement Learning 
13.	Week 13: Hidden Markov Models

The lab part also required two projects, which are included in this repository. Both projects involve the creation of multiple machine learning models using R.

## Project 1 - Data set Classification Analysis

In this project, you will apply three algorithms (KNN - K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees and Multilayer Perceptron) to two data sets (Iris and Contact Lens, both from UCI). The data and the algorithms are provided by R. 

Please answer each question in the order they appear. Do not skip to later steps to answer earlier questions that ask you to predict outcomes based on your analysis of the data and understanding of the algorithms. 
due date.

## Project 2 - Unsupervised and Supervise Learning

In this project we performed analysis on two the same data sets (iris and contact lens) as in the previous project using five different types of machine learning algorithms and techniques:
* Clustering – Simple K-means
* PCA – Principal Component Analysis
* SVM – Support Vector Machines
* Random Forest
* AdaBoost
The analysis was done using R and libraries for each type of algorithm used. The report is accompanied by an R markup document with all the code and its output to support all answers and reasoning presented here.
